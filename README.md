Hackathon Submission for AI for Connectivity II
Enabling resilient, efficient connectivity for schools and healthcare facilities

Open in Hugging Face Spaces

üìñ Problem Statement
Public sector networks in underserved regions face critical challenges:

Challenge	Impact
High Energy Costs	40-60% of operational budgets spent on power
Unplanned Downtime	15-20% annual connectivity loss in schools
Inefficient Maintenance	Reactive repairs cost 3-5√ó more than preventive
Environmental Impact	Each facility emits 12-18 tons CO‚ÇÇ annually
This solution directly addresses these issues through AI-driven optimization of network infrastructure.
